    <div class="best-time-body">
      <p class="slide-body slide-body--best-time">LEMONS ARE BEST IN WINTER AND EARLY SPRING, BEING JUICIER AND MORE FLAVORFUL THEN, AS IT'S WHEN THE TREE NATURALLY PRODUCES THE MOST FRUIT. GINGER IS NOT SEASONAL AND CAN BE GROWN YEAR-ROUND, THOUGH IT TAKES TIME TO MATURE. THEREFORE, THE BEST TIME FOR THIS RECIPE IS LATE WINTER OR EARLY SPRING DUE TO THE LEMONS. THE RECIPE CAN TECHNICALLY BE MADE YEAR-ROUND WITH YEAR-ROUND AVAILABILITY OF GINGER AND LEMONS, BUT THE LEMON FLAVOR WON'T BE PEAK IF IT'S NOT LEMON SEASON.</p>
