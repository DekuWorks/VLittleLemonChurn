    <p class="slide-body slide-body--egg-whites">EGG WHITES ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY BIND THE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER. THEY ARE MADE OF PROTEIN THAT CHANGES SHAPE WHEN WHIPPED, TRAPPING AIR AND CREATING LIGHTNESS AND FLUFFINESS. THIS FORMS A STRONG STRUCTURE THAT GIVES THE ICE CREAM A SMOOTH AND CONSISTENT TEXTURE.</p>
