        <p class="restrictions-text">THIS RECIPE USES HEAVY CREAM AND EGG WHITES WHICH MANY PEOPLE CANNOT HAVE BECAUSE OF ALLERGIES OR DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.</p>
        <ul class="restrictions-list">
          <li>MILK/DAIRY ALLERGIES REQUIRE AVOIDING THINGS LIKE CREAM, MILK, CHEESE, AND ICE CREAM.</li>

        <p class="restrictions-text">A VEGAN DIET EXCLUDES ALL ANIMAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DAIRY AND EGGS. SO, THIS RECIPE IS NOT CONSUMABLE FOR VEGANS SADLY.</p>
        <p class="restrictions-text">VEGETARIAN DIET DOES HOWEVER FOR THE MOST PART ALLOW DAIRY AND EGGS. SO, THIS RECIPE COULD BE CONSUMED BY SOMEONE WHO IS VEGETARIAN SINCE THERE IS NO GELATIN OR OTHER ANIMAL DERIVED INGREDIENTS IN THIS RECIPE.</p>

        <ul class="restrictions-list">
          <li>THE KOSHER DIET IS JEWISH DIETARY LAWS THAT INVOLVE SPECIFIC RULES ABOUT HOW FOODS ARE PREPARED AND WHAT COMBINATIONS ARE ALLOWED. FOODS WITH DAIRY CANNOT BE SERVED WITH MEAT MEALS.</li>
          <li>KOSHER DIETS REQUIRE FOODS TO MEET VERY SPECIFIC PREPARATION AND INGREDIENT GUIDELINES. CREAM AND EGGS CAN BE KOSHER IF CERTIFIED, BUT THE KITCHEN MUST AVOID MEAT/DAIRY MIXING AND FOLLOW ALL OF THE KOSHER KITCHEN RULES. FRUITS LIKE LEMONS AND GINGER THEMSELVES ARE INHERENTLY NEUTRAL BUT STILL MUST BE CHECKED.</li>
          <li>THE HALAL DIET IS A MUSLIM DIETARY LAW THAT PROHIBITS PORK AND ALCOHOL AND REQUIRES CERTAIN SLAUGHTER PRACTICES FOR MEAT.</li>
          <li>HALAL DIETS ALLOW MOST FOOD BUT REQUIRE THAT ANY ANIMAL DERIVED PRODUCTS ARE PROCESSED IN A WAY THAT COMPLIES WITH ISLAMIC LAW. THIS RECIPE DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY OBVIOUS INGREDIENTS THAT GO AGAINST HALAL DIET.</li>
