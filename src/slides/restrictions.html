        <p class="restrictions-text">THIS RECIPE USES HEAVY CREAM AND EGG WHITES WHICH MANY PEOPLE CANNOT HAVE BECAUSE OF ALLERGIES OR DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.</p>
        <ul class="restrictions-list">
          <li>MILK/DAIRY ALLERGIES REQUIRE AVOIDING THINGS LIKE CREAM, MILK, CHEESE, AND ICE CREAM.</li>
          <li>EGG ALLERGIES MEAN AVOIDING ANY FORM OF THE EGG (WHITE, YOLK, POWDER) IT IS VERY SERIOUS FOR THOSE AFFECTED.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="restrictions-heading">VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN DIETS</h3>
        <p class="restrictions-text">A VEGAN DIET EXCLUDES ALL ANIMAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DAIRY AND EGGS. SO THIS RECIPE IS NOT CONSUMABLE FOR VEGANS SADLY.</p>
        <p class="restrictions-text">VEGETARIAN DIET DOES HOWEVER FOR THE MOST PART ALLOW DAIRY AND EGGS. SO THIS RECIPE COULD BE CONSUMED BY SOMEONE WHO IS VEGETARIAN SINCE THERE IS NO GELATIN OR OTHER ANIMAL DERIVED INGREDIENTS IN THIS RECIPE.</p>
