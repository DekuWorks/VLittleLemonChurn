      <p class="cooking-method-intro">LEMON GINGER NO-CHURN ICE CREAM USES A METHOD THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE AN ICE CREAM MACHINE. INSTEAD OF CHURNING AND FREEZING, AIR IS INCORPORATED INTO THE MIXTURE, AND THEN IT'S FROZEN UNTIL SOLID. THE METHOD RELIES ON HEAVY CREAM AND EGG WHITES TO ACHIEVE A CREAMY, SMOOTH TEXTURE.</p>

        <h3 class="cooking-method-heading">COOKWARE NEEDED</h3>
        <ul class="cooking-method-list">
          <li><strong>A LARGE MIXING BOWL (IDEALLY METAL):</strong> THIS HELPS THE EGG WHITES HOLD AIR EASIER</li>
          <li><strong>EITHER A HAND MIXER OR A STAND MIXER:</strong> WHIPPING THE EGG WHITES AND HEAVY CREAM UNTIL STIFF PEAKS</li>
          <li><strong>SPATULA:</strong> FLEXIBLE SPATULA TO FOLD INGREDIENTS TOGETHER GENTLY, KEEPING THE AIR INSIDE THE EGG WHITES</li>
          <li><strong>FREEZER-SAFE CONTAINER:</strong> THIS COULD BE A LOAF PAN, METAL PAN, OR PLASTIC CONTAINER WITH A LID OR COVER FOR FREEZING THE ICE CREAM.</li>

        <h3 class="cooking-method-heading">SPECIAL TECHNIQUES</h3>
        <ol class="cooking-method-list cooking-method-list--numbered">
          <li><strong>WHIPPING TO STIFF PEAKS:</strong> WHIPPING CREAM UNTIL STIFF PEAKS FORM INCORPORATES AIR, GIVING THE ICE CREAM VOLUME AND PREVENTING IT FROM BEING DENSE OR ICY. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STEPS IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN NO CHURN ICE CREAM.</li>
          <li><strong>FOLDING:</strong> FOLD EGG WHITES AND HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM GENTLY INTO THE LEMON AND GINGER FLAVOR TO ENSURE TRAPPED AIR DOESN'T ESCAPE. USE A SPATULA IN A SLOW LIGHT MOTION TO KEEP THE MIXTURE AIRY.</li>
          <li><strong>FREEZING THE ICE CREAM:</strong> THE ICE CREAM MUST SIT FOR AT LEAST 3 HOURS IN A FREEZER-SAFE PAN. IMPORTANT SINCE THE ICE CREAM IS NOT IN A CONSTANT STATE OF CHURNING.</li>
