      <p class="slide-body slide-body--why">I CHOSE THIS LEMON GINGER NO-CHURN ICE CREAM RECIPE BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING I WOULD ENJOY EATING. WHEN LOOKING AT COLD DESSERT RECIPES, MANY OF THE OPTIONS SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING I WOULD NOT TOUCH WITH A 39 AND A HALF FOOT POLL. THIS ONE HOWEVER STOOD OUT TO ME. I CHOSE GINGER BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS BETTER IN A DESSERT THAN CARROTS. FINDING THIS RECIPE AND HEARING LEMON AND GINGER IN IT SOUNDED REFRESHING AND MADE IT SEEM LIKE THE FLAVORS WOULD BALANCE OUT VERY WELL. ALSO THESE TWO FLAVORS CAN HELP THE OTHER FLAVOR NOT BE TO OVERBEARING. CHOOSING A RECIPE I WOULD MAKE MADE ME HAVE MORE PASSION FOR DOING THIS PROJECT AND FOR TO ACTUALLY BE EXCITED IN HAVING TO DO THE RESEARCH.</p>
